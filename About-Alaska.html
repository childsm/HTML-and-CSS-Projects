			John Muir, the famous naturalist, wrote in his journal that you should never go to Alaska as a young man because you'll never be satisfied with any other place as long as you live. And there's a lot of thruth to that. <em>~Tom Bodett</em>

			<p>Alaska was nicknamed <em>The Last Frontier</em> because of its rugged landscape, vast uncharted areas, and distance from the lower 48 states.</p>
			<p>Alaska has another nickname, <em>Land of the Midnight Sun</em> due to many areas where the sun is still up at midnight at summer soltice. 
			<br>In Barrow Alaska during the summer the sun will not set for more than <em>80</em> days!</p>
